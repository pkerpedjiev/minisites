<h1>King's Jewels Problem</h1>

<body>
    A long time ago, in a land far away, a gallant knight rescues the king's
    life. To show his gratitude, the king offers him one of his jewels as a
    reward. The king, however, is eccetric and demands the knight follow a
    certain procedure when making his choice. He must pick a jewel from the
    treasure chest at random, and immediately decide if he wants it. If he
    wants it, the jewel is his and he goes home. If he doesn't, the jewel is
    placed in another chest and can never be chosen again. The knight gets to
    pick again as long as there are jewels left in the chest. The king,
    generous as he is eccentric, tells the knight the number of jewels in the
    box before he begins picking.

    How should the knight proceed if he wants to score the best jewel in chest?
    Should he just take the first one he picks or should he look at a few before
    deciding on one to take home? If so, how many?
