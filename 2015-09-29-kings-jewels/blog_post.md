You have just saved the king's life an he wants to reward you with one of his
many jewels. There's a catch though. You're only allowed to look at one jewel
at a time and decide then whether you want it or not. If you decide you don't
like it, it's gone forever and you can only pick from the remaining jewels. The
king, generous as he is, also does you the favor of telling you how many jewels
he has. What do you, as someone who wants to get the best bit of booty, do?

Let's start simple. If the king tells you there's only one jewel, you take it
because if you don't you get nothing. If he tells you that there's two jewels,
you can either take the first or the second. If you don't take the first, you
have to take the second or go home empty handed. If there's three, the
situation becomes more interesting. The chances that the best jewel is the
first one are one third. You look at it and throw it out. Now you have two
jewels left and knowledge of what the first one looked like. Each of the
remaining two has a 1/3 probability that it's the best one. If the second (the
one you have in your hand right now) is better than the first, you keep it
because you now know that the chances that it's the best one are 2/3.  If it's
worse, then you throw it out because you're certain it's not the best one and
you still have that 1/3 chance of the net jewel being the best.

What if there are four jewels?
